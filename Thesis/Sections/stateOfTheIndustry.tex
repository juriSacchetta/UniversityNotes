There are several solutions available on the market that provides flexible infrastructure management and are built to automate the management of the infrastructure of an application. These systems can be seen as schedulers (so software components that organize when a task is executed and on which resources) with some additional features as the capability of actually \textit{allocate} the resources needed or the automated management of the interfaces between resources and components.

\subsection{Shifter}
\label{sse:shifter}
  Shifter is a simple scheduler which aims to utilize the container format in an HPC environment. It allows the user to specify the load in a docker image, then Shifter automates the conversion of that image to an HPC format and the scheduling of such task. Shifter is \textit{not} an extension of Docker or the Docker engine, nor aims to automate the infrastructure, instead it just provides an additional interface (which is container compatible) to an already existing HPC platform.
