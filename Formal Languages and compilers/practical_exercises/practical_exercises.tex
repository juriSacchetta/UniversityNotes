        \subsection{Indistinguishable states}
            While speaking of clean automaton \ref{sect:cleanautom}, a \emph{practical} translation of the definition \ref{def:undiststates}, chapter is: two states are 
            undistinguishable if the outgoing arcs with the same label brings to the same state (and their outgoing arcs have the same lable), or, in other words, 
            equal lable $\Rightarrow$ same state.
        \subsection{Linear Language Equations}\label{ese:linlangeq}
            Referring to section \ref{sect:linlangeq}
            In order to pass from grammar rules to linear language equations, substitute the $\vert$ symbol with $\bigcup$, and each nonterminal with a sublanguage.
