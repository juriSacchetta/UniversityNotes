# University notes from Politecnico di Milano

## What is this repo?

This is my personal repository to keep updated and in sync among my devices my
notes from my University master courses. I try to keep it updated during lectures
time and I use this notes to study before exams, as an *extended summary* of
the courses content.

## What is NOT this repo?

All the content in this repository is **NOT** official material from courses or
lectures, and should **NOT** replace the official material given by professors
to fully study or comprehend a subject. In some notes are included images or
snippets from the professor's notes.
***These are PERSONAL NOTES taken by a STUDENT in order to STUDY better***,
they are not surely 100% correct and can contain imprecisions and omissions.
***Do not rely only on this to prepare an exam***,

***Do not rely only on this to prepare an exam***.

## How is this repo?

I take and organize my notes in LaTeX and then compile them to PDF, in order to
read them and share them easily. I include here the source .tex file and the
compiled PDFs.

## Why this repo?

I think I'll waste my effort to write them if I'm the only one to use these
notes. So here they are. But remember: ***use these at your own risk***. I
strongly suggest to **not** use only this to prepare an exam, let alone
understanding a subject.

## What does this repo contain?

I'll list here all the courses I've attended during my master course in
Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, and of which

## What should I do with this repo?

- Can't stress this enough: ***DO NOT RELY SOLELY ON THESE NOTES 
TO PREPARE EXAMS***
- Feel free to modify these notes, but to change the GitHub version,
contact me (I respond in both english and italian)
- Feel free to redistribute these notes, with these additional notes
included

Good luck with your exams.
